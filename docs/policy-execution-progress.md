# Policy Execution Progress

Scope: G04 in [the target gap audit](implementation-gap-audit.md).
This is an incremental behavior ledger, not a completion declaration.

## Slice 1: Preview Does Not Enforce

- Red: `TestPipelinePreviewPolicyDoesNotActivateRequiredChecks` exposed an
  `effective-policy` activation created from preview-only checks.
- Green: persist explicit enforcement state and only activate enforced checks.
- Regression: `TestPipelineEnforcedPolicyActivatesRequiredChecks` proves the
  positive enforcement path is retained.
- Verification: full `go test ./...`; uncached pipeline/review package tests
  after adding the positive-path assertion.

## Slice 2: Enforce Model And Reasoner-Tool Capabilities

- Red: six read tools returned data despite denied `repo.read`; serial, streaming
  and parallel model paths invoked providers despite denied `model.review`.
- Green: persist and clone the effective capability intersection; require policy
  permission at model dispatch and both policy/skill permission for reasoner tools.
- Tool schemas in prompts and native requests reflect actual eligibility. A
  model-requested forbidden tool receives a denial without a result, including
  on followup rounds.
- Old persisted enforce-mode records without capability fields fail closed;
  preview/legacy execution remains observational/unrestricted by this policy layer.
- Verification: full `go test ./...`; race tests for pipeline, orchestrator,
  review and CI packages; persistence, positive permission and negative tests.
- Boundary: this slice guards the current reasoner tools and model orchestrator.
  It is not the future action-level permission system, nor a claim that all
  enrichment/publication effects are capability-governed.

## Remaining

Trusted method-content resolution and execution; remaining effect capabilities;
operator ceilings; scoped conflicts/prerequisites; independent investigation;
publication restrictions and all remaining G04 acceptance variants remain open.
Required-check activation alone is not proof of check satisfaction.
